# General

If your host machine uses multiple GPUs, you may want to primarily use a GPU for rendering all the elements for Hyprland including windows, animations, hardware acceleration for certain applications, etc.

This setup is very common in the likes of gaming laptops, GPU-passthrough(without VFIO) capable hosts, and if you have multiple GPUs in general.

# Detecting GPUs

For this case, the writer is taking the example of their laptop.

Upon running `lspci | grep -E 'VGA|3D'`, One can list all the video devices available.

```
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation TU117M [GeForce GTX 1650 Mobile / Max-Q] (rev a1)
06:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] Cezanne [Radeon Vega Series / Radeon Vega Mobile Series] (rev c6)
```

Here it is clear that 2 GPUs are available, the dedicated NVIDIA GTX 1650 Mobile / Max-Q and the integrated AMD Cezanne Radeon Vega Series GPU.

Now, run `ls -l /dev/dri/by-path`

```
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  8 Jul 14 15:45 pci-0000:01:00.0-card -> ../card0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Jul 14 15:45 pci-0000:01:00.0-render -> ../renderD128
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  8 Jul 14 15:45 pci-0000:06:00.0-card -> ../card1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 Jul 14 15:45 pci-0000:06:00.0-render -> ../renderD129
```

So from the above outputs, we can match the bus IDs and determine that NVIDIA is `card0` and AMD is `card1`.

# Telling Hyprland which GPU to use

After determining which "card" belongs to which GPU, we now have to tell Hyprland the GPU we want to use primarily.

{{< hint type=info >}}

It is generally a good idea for laptops to use the integrated GPU as the primary renderer as this preserves battery life and is practically indistinguishable from using the dedicated GPU on modern systems in most cases. Hyprland can be run on integrated GPUs just fine. The same principle applies for desktop setups with a lower and higher power rating GPUs respectively.

{{< /hint >}}

We can do so by using `WLR_DRM_DEVICES` variable.

Add the following template to `hyprland.conf`

```ini

env = WLR_DRM_DEVICES,/dev/dri/cardN

```

For our case, we want to use `card1` primarily and use it to render stuff. 

```ini

env = WLR_DRM_DEVICES,/dev/dri/card1:/dev/dri/card0

```

Here, we tell Hyprland to set priorities. If `card1` isn't available for whatever reason, use `card0`. So if the AMD GPU isn't available, use NVIDIA. The colon is for setting priorities, essentially.

After setting this, now we confirm whether the settings applied actually work or not.

To test whether the NVIDIA card is rendering anything, lets check the output of `nvidia-smi`

This is with running a browser and some other stuff. We can confidentally say NVIDIA is not doing anything and is idling.
